The short course will provide a quick overview of Bayesian applications in environmental and ecological studies, with examples and code from [Qian et al (2023)](https://github.com/songsqian/BeesRStan/).  I will provide several Rmarkdown files for you to practice.  For best experience, I recommend that you bring your own laptop to the workshop, with R and RStudio installed.  I want to make the workshop informal with time to answer questions when they arise.  I will not use power-point presentation. Instead, I will walk through the Rmarkdown files and explain the materials. For this reason, I would like to ask that you make certain preparations.   All course materials (data, code, references) are available at [Github](https://github.com/songsqian/BeesRStan/), follow the link to [SFS](https://github.com/songsqian/BeesRStan/tree/main/SFS) for Rmd files used in the short course.

## Preparing R and RStan
I recommend that you update your R and RStudio to avoid version-specific issues.  All materials were tested using the most recent version of R (4.3.0, "Already Tomorrow") and RStudio (2023.03.1+446 "Cherry Blossom").  We will use Stan for all Bayesian computation, via R package `rstan`, which requires access to C compiling toolchain. (Windows users, make sure that you also install `Rtools`. The current version is [Rtools43](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html).) Please follow the following instructions from Stan developers to properly install `rstan`:

- For Windows users using the recent versions of R (4.3 and 4.2), the current version of RStan available from CRAN is not compatible and will return error messages. You need to install the preview of `rstan` 2.26 running the following commends:

```
remove.packages(c("StanHeaders", "rstan"))
install.packages("StanHeaders", 
  repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
install.packages("rstan", 
  repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```

- For Mac users, please refer to [Stan Github](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C---Toolchain-for-Mac) for details.

- For Linus users, you are most likely fine. Check [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C-Toolchain-for-Linux) just in case.

## Preparing your laptop
You should create an empty folder on your laptop for this short course and download all `.Rmd` and `.RData` files from the [course repository](https://github.com/songsqian/BeesRStan/tree/main/SFS) into this folder.  Data files used in the class will be accessed via internet.  If you don't have internet access on site, you need to download and clone the [GitHub page](https://github.com/songsqian/BeesRStan/) onto your laptop **ahead of time**.  I will bring a copy of all necessary files with me just in case. 

## Your Data Examples
To enhance the workshop's usefulness, I have structured the day into four sessions. Here's a breakdown of each session:

- Introductory Session: We will start with an introductory session that focuses on a simple problem that doesn't necessarily require Bayesian statistics or the computational power of Stan. This session serves as a foundation for understanding key concepts.

- Bayesian Benefits and Model Evaluation: After the morning tea-break, we will delve into the benefits of Bayesian analysis, particularly emphasizing the advantages of using Stan for model evaluation. We will explore two examples where the probability distribution of the response variable is complex, showcasing the power of Bayesian approaches.

- Bayesian Hierarchical Models: In the afternoon, I have prepared three examples centered around my favorite topic: Bayesian hierarchical models. These examples will provide an in-depth understanding of how hierarchical models can be effectively utilized in Bayesian analyses.

- Participant Data Examples: During the last couple of hours of the day, we will open the floor for discussion and analysis of data examples brought by participants. If you have an example you'd like to share, please send it (\url{song.qian@utoledo.edu}) to me ahead of time (before May 31, US time). I will do my best to include it in the final session and provide insights based on the shared data.

By structuring the day in this manner, we aim to cover various aspects of Bayesian analysis, progressively building knowledge and offering opportunities for practical application.
