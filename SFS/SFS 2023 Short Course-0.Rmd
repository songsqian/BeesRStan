## Preparing R and RStan
For Windows users using the recent versions of R (4.3 and 4.2), the current version of RStan available from CRAN is not compatible and will return error messages. You need to install the preview of `rstan` 2.26 running the following commends:

```
remove.packages(c("StanHeaders", "rstan"))
install.packages("StanHeaders", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
install.packages("rstan", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```

For Mac users, please refer to [Stan Github](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C---Toolchain-for-Mac) for details.

For Linus users, you are most likely fine. Check [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C-Toolchain-for-Linux) just in case.
